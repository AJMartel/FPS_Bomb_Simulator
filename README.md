# Introduction

The FPS Bomb Simulator is a device that is meant to bring the excitement of console games such as Battlefield ™, Call of Duty™, and CounterStrike™ to real life. The FPS Bomb Simulator can augment any Airsoft, Paintball, Milsim or Laser-tag game, especially for players who love the game type in which Terrorists and Counter-terrorists battle against each other to plant and/or defuse a bomb. The Domination game mode is perfect for those that are more into a “King of the Hill” type games. The “Armed\!” game mode with the “Passcode” enabled could also be used in an Escape Room scenario, find clues to get the passcode before it explodes\!

# Addon Modules

All game modules are “Plug and Play” and easy to install.

To install any of the modules, use the following steps:

1.  Remove the battery. (The FPS Bomb Simulator must be fully powered off.)

2.  Modules are keyed and will fit into only one slot, place the module in the corresponding “slot”.

3.  Replace the battery.

4.  Power on the device.

The modules are automatically detected upon device startup. Game configuration options for each individual module will only become available once a module has been enumerated.

## Relay Module

The “Relay Module” can be used with both Basic and Pro Editions of the FPS Bomb Simulator. It enables external lights based on the status of the RGB LED and it can be used to activate an external device when the “bomb” explodes. The “Relay Module” is available in all game modes.

## Cutwire Module

The “Cut wire Module” can be used with both Basic and Pro Editions of the FPS Bomb Simulator. This module is meant to be used as a last second option to disarm the bomb.

It is available in “Search & Destroy”, “Sabotage” and “Armed\!” game modes.

When the timer is under the required time to disarm or arm the bomb, take your chances cut a wire. Adds the adrenaline rust of suicide or success\! If any of the wires are cut before the bomb is armed the module will automatically be disabled.

## MP3 Sound Module

The “MP3 Sound Module”, enable actual voice prompts (in chosen language) at key points of the game.

With “voice in” enabled Walkie-Talkies broadcast to the entire game area\!

Requires “Pro Edition” FPS Bomb Simulator device and is available in all game modes.

## Wireless Modules

The Wireless Modules are sold as “Master” or “Slave”. They require at least two “Pro Edition” FPS Bomb Simulators in order to use these modules. Adds two new game modes: “Remote Domination” and “Capture the Flag”.

# Game Modes

There are two Models of the FPS Bomb Simulator, “BASIC” and “PRO”.

The “BASIC” Model has four game modes to choose from.

The “PRO” Model has the four “BASIC” game modes with the possibility of an additional two game modes. Additional game modes require at least two “PRO” Models with “Wireless modules” installed.

##  Search & Destroy

In this mode the device acts as a bomb.

Red button Arms bomb

Green button Disarms bomb

When "Passcode" mode is used:

1.  > Passcode entry has a programable input time limit.

2.  > "A" is used to initialize passcode entry to Arm the bomb.

3.  > "D" is used to initialize passcode entry to Disarm the bomb.

Common for both "passcode" and button modes:

1.  > The bomb can be armed and defused only once.

2.  > The bomb has to be defended by the GREEN team during Game Time.

3.  > The attacking RED team's objective is to arm the bomb and once armed must prevent the GREEN team from defusing it, until it detonates.

There are three ways to finish the game.

1.  Game time expires and RED team was unsuccessful in placing and arming the bomb, GREEN team wins.

2.  RED team is able to place and arm the bomb, but can not prevent GREEN team from disarming it. GREEN team wins.

3.  RED team is able to place and arm the bomb and GREEN team fails in disarming it, the bomb detonates. RED team wins.
    
    8.  ## Sabotage

Green button Captures zone for GREEN Team

Green button Neutralizes RED zone

1.  When game starts the base is a Neutral (BLUE) Zone.

2.  The objective for both (GREEN and RED) teams is to capture the base.

3.  Once the base is captured, it starts to count time for the controlling team.

4.  While the base is neutral no time is accumulated for either team.

The only way to win is:

1.  > The team with the highest total time in control of the base wins.
    
    10. ## Armed\!

In this mode the device acts as a bomb.

Green button Disarms bomb

When "Passcode" mode is used:

1.  > Passcode entry has a programable input time limit.

2.  > "D" is used to initialize passcode entry to Disarm the bomb.

Common for both "passcode" and button modes:

1.  > The bomb starts armed with the countdown to detonation already triggered.

There are two ways to finish the game.

1.  The bomb time expires and the GREEN team was unsuccessful in disarming the bomb, and it detonates RED team wins.
